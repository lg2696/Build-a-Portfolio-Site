Current Issues:

Header:
1.) Udacity logo is only appearing for the mobile view, it is not displaying for Tablet or Desktop views. 
Not sure what I am doing wrong. -Corrected

2.) Have the logo and text in the Header be aligned so they appear on the same row. -Corrected

Container:
3.) Cannot get the Web_tool image to appear.

4.) The Appify logo/links keep jumping up to be on the same line as the Web Image. 
When the screen is stretched to desk top screen, I want all three logos/links to appear below the Web Tools image.  
As they screen shrinks to tablet and mobile, the logos should eventually line up under one column.

each column is .08333 in width or 8.33%

header column-width would be .50%

Web_tool = 100%
